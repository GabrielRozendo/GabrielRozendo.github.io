> _¡Hola, bienvenido 👋!_, I'm **Gabriel Rozendo**, a Brazilian 🇧🇷 Software Engineer.

- After a while in Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹, now I'm based in Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸.

- I build IT 👨‍💻 related things (mostly mobile apps lately), checkout [/cv/projects](/cv/projects) (those are public so far 👀).
- Also have a [/homelab](/homelab) (computer, other kind of science 🧪), few automations, self hosting services for privacy, costs and for fun! Cannot say I don't break some of them usually in process ⛓️‍💥🔨. Struggling with DNS eventually, of course.
