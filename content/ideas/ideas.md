> Most people have an about page.. this is my NOW page. This is the page that summarises my current focus and priorities. I recommend you create a NOW page too.

This is my dedicated now page, which is described as “what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year”. It summarises my life as it is right now. You can also keep up to date on my timeline.



This is what I am not doing now:

Worrying about my weight
Worrying about the future
Jumping to the past
Punishing myself for “anything”
Thinking it is the other person’s fault (unless it is)
Carrying the burden of the past into the present
